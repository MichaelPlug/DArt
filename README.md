# DArt
DArt is a decentaliced app built on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain to build a public and distributed ledger about cultural heritage.

## Goal
The goal of the project is to build a public ledger using the blockchain to take trace about the management of each cultural heritage. Contrary to many modern projects, DArt does not propose itself as a digitization of artistic material, but as a tool for managing it in the real world. The goal of DArt is not to impose a digital point of view on art, but to put modern technologies at the service of humanistic and artistic culture for the management of cultural heritage according to what is modern ethic.
The intent of DArt is to constitute a support element for actors in the art world to migrate towards the international modern definition of museum:

   > A museum is a not-for-profit, permanent institution in the service of society that researches, collects, conserves, interprets and exhibits tangible and intangible heritage. Open to the public, accessible and inclusive, museums foster diversity and sustainability. They operate and communicate ethically, professionally and with the participation of communities, offering varied experiences for education, enjoyment, reflection and knowledge sharing - ICOM, August 2022

# Smartcontracts
The DApp consists of four different smart contracts:
- DCoin.sol manages the fungible tokens of DArt, the Dcoins and the Patron credits
- Verification.sol has the role to manage the opening of a request of verification and to accept the pending request by the creator
- Patron.sol is the smartcontract dedicated to the crowdfunding
- DArt.sol is the main smartcontract and manage all the minting of NFT in the DApp and their management and trasnfers.
